PHASE: implement

Goal: Provide the exact file contents needed to satisfy the plan.

IMPORTANT: You are in a non-interactive mode. You cannot use tools or edit files directly.
Instead, output the full content of each file that needs to be created or modified.
The orchestrator will apply these changes for you.

For each file in the plan:
- Provide the complete file path
- Specify the action: create, modify, or delete
- Include the FULL file content (not a diff or patch)

Return JSON matching schema/implement_output.schema.json
